    <p>You thing we were dead?</p>
    <p>A mad idea can't be killed this easy.</p>
    <p>An thou our hopes are scattered like sand</p>
    <p>And every outcome we wanted</p>
    <p>Sits above us, were haunted</p>
    <p>You should've cut deeper</p>
    <p>Buried our grave to fill</p>
    <p>Soon we will have all of your heads</p>
    <p>You should've checked were was dead!</p></div>
